  // Protobuf versions. Thus, an updated version of the message received by a 
  // non-updated application will automatically discard new fields to remain 
  // stable and working properly. As a result, new fields added to .proto files 
  // should be enumerated following the ongoing sequence e.g. "string name = 2;"
  //  might be an example of how expanding the current file.
